# Using Mixture of Gaussian model to distinguish apple and non-apple pixels

Genrating posterior probability masks to differentiate apple and non-apple pixels given an image using Mixuture of Gaussian model. 

The model is trained using Expectation Maximsation algorithm. Evaluated model performace by plotting the ROC curve.
The code and further description can be found in the notebook [here](https://github.com/SulakshanaChakraborty/MixtureOfGaussian/blob/main/practicalMixGauss_Apples.ipynb).
